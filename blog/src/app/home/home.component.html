<h2>WHAT WE DO ?</h2>
<p>Anudip Foundation beneficiaries, youth and women, are from high-need, marginalized communities; they may be religious minorities, tribals, political refugees, people with disabilities or victims of trafficking. Recognized as an NGO for women and needy, Anudip leads its beneficiaries through a process of continuous improvement, in-depth and diverse training and continuous mentoring at the various skill development training centres across India.

    As a CSR Implementation Partner for corporates like Accenture, JP Morgan, Capgemini, Wells Fargo, Unilever, Citi, HSBC, Cisco, ITC, ICRA and others, we create digital livelihoods for marginalized youth, vulnerable women and the needy across emerging economies. Each year hundreds of individuals choose ANUDIP as their NGO for volunteering and consider us as a best NGO to donate in India with an aim to transform lives.
